Part 1 – Debugging Scenario<br>
Design a debugging scenario, and write your report as a conversation on EdStem. It should have:<br>

The original post from a student with a screenshot showing a symptom and a description of a guess at the bug/some sense of what the failure-inducing input is. (Don’t actually make the post! Just write the content that would go in such a post)<br>
A response from a TA asking a leading question or suggesting a command to try (To be clear, you are mimicking a TA here.)<br>
Another screenshot/terminal output showing what information the student got from trying that, and a clear description of what the bug is.<br>
At the end, all the information needed about the setup including:<br>
The file & directory structure needed<br>
The contents of each file before fixing the bug<br>
The full command line (or lines) you ran to trigger the bug<br>
A description of what to edit to fix the bug<br>
You should actually set up and run the scenario from your screenshots. It should involve at least a Java file and a bash script. Describing the bug should involve reading some output at the terminal resulting from running one or more commands. Design an error that produces more interesting output than a single message about a syntax or unbound identifier error – showcase some interesting wrong behavior! Feel free to set this up by cloning and breaking some existing code like the grading script or code from class, or by designing something of your own from scratch, etc.

#### Part 2 – Reflection

I've said it once, but I really liked learning about Vim. It seems like such a impressive tool that is able to do many different things, specifically without having to use a track pad or mouse which I've been told drastically increases the speed of the work you do which, based on my personal experiences am inclined to agree with. Although I'm still new to things in it I hope the skills I've learned from in lab/class and from friends will be of help in the future. I'm still fairly unclear on some of the things but I'm sure if I dedicate a decent amount of time, consulting the internet, friends and perhaps even chatGPT I'll get quite good at it!
