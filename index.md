**The commands without Arguments**
- "cd" did nothing and only created a new line waiting for another command

- "ls" wrote in the terminal the only item in the workplace "lecture1" then created a new line waiting for another command

- "cat" was a little more interesting while it didn't write anything to the terminal and did create a new line it didn't have [user@sahara~]$ instead anything that I wrote afterwards would be repeated as though I had called the cat command on those statements. In order to leave I learned via google that ctrl-d would allow me to back track to once again show [user@sahara~]$
